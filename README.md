# BANKING PROJECT

Banking Project
This is a banking project developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was developed as part of 'The Complete JavaScript Course' taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. The project implements a login system, transitions, DOM manipulation, and a timer to log out the user.

## Features

Login system with form validation
Dashboard with account balance, recent transactions, and loan calculator
Smooth transitions between pages
Automatic logout after 5 minutes of inactivity
Getting started
To run this project, you can simply open the index.html file in your browser.

Alternatively, you can run a local server using Node.js. To do this, follow these steps:

Install Node.js on your computer if you haven't already.
Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command npm install to install the required packages.
Run the command npm start to start the server.
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
Usage
Once the project is running, you can use the login form to log in to the dashboard. You can use the following credentials to log in:

Username: js
Password: 1111
Once you're logged in, you can view your account balance, recent transactions, and use the loan calculator to calculate your loan payments.

### Customizations

I have made a few changes to the original project. In particular, I have modified the way the transitions and the login system work.

Feel free to customize the project further to suit your needs. You can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed.
